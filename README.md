# revmc

Experimental [JIT] and [AOT] compiler for the [Ethereum Virtual Machine][EVM].

The compiler implementation is abstracted over an intermediate representation backend. It performs very well, as demonstrated below from our criterion benchmarks, and exposes an intuitive API via Revm.

The compiler backend is abstracted behind a trait ([`revmc-backend`]), with an [LLVM] implementation ([`revmc-llvm`]) providing full test coverage.

## Requirements

- Latest stable Rust version

### LLVM backend

- Linux or macOS, Windows is not supported
- LLVM 22
  - On Debian-based Linux distros: see [apt.llvm.org](https://apt.llvm.org/)
  - On Arch-based Linux distros: `pacman -S llvm`
  - On macOS: `brew install llvm@22`
  - The following environment variables may be required:
    ```bash
    prefix=$(llvm-config --prefix)
    # or
    #prefix=$(llvm-config-22 --prefix)
    # on macOS:
    #prefix=$(brew --prefix llvm@22)
    export LLVM_SYS_221_PREFIX=$prefix
    ```

## Usage

The compiler is implemented as a library and can be used as such through the `revmc` crate.

A minimal runtime is required to run AOT-compiled bytecodes. A default runtime implementation is
provided through symbols exported in the `revmc-builtins` crate and must be exported in the final
binary. This can be achieved with the following build script:
```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    revmc_build::emit();
}
```

You can check out the [examples](/examples) directory for example usage.

## Profiling

If the `ENABLE_JITPROFILING` environment variable is set, the compiler will create and register
an event listener for JIT profiling. This allows profilers such as
[samply](https://github.com/mstange/samply) and [perf](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org) to resolve
JIT-compiled function names and source locations.

## Testing

The [Ethereum state tests](https://github.com/ethereum/tests) are included as a git submodule.
The submodule is configured with `update = none` so it won't be cloned automatically.

To check it out:

```bash
git submodule update --init --checkout --depth 1 tests/ethereum-tests
```

Then run the state tests:

```bash
# All three modes (interpreter baseline, JIT, AOT):
cargo nextest run -p revmc -E 'test(statetest::)'

# A specific mode:
cargo nextest run -p revmc -E 'test(statetest::jit)'

# A specific test subdirectory:
SUBDIR=stSelfBalance cargo nextest run -p revmc -E 'test(statetest::jit)'
```
